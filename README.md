# Binomial Theorem Interactive Visualization

A modern, interactive web app for exploring the binomial theorem visually! Perfect for students, educators, and anyone curious about algebraic patterns, combinations, and probability.

## 🚀 Features

- **Visualize Binomial Expansions:**
  - See the terms of $(a+b)^n$ built step by step.
  - Select the number of factors ($n$) and watch the expansion unfold.
- **Pascal's Triangle:**
  - Instantly see how binomial coefficients relate to Pascal's Triangle.
- **Interactive Exploration:**
  - Click to choose $a$ or $b$ for each factor and see the resulting term.
  - Try Challenge Mode to find all combinations for a given term!
- **Simulation Mode:**
  - Run random experiments and view the resulting histogram for term frequencies.
- **Summary and Reflection:**
  - Review what you learned and discover key insights about the binomial distribution.
